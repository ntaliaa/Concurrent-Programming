2.3 Narrow Bridge (Traffic Synchronization)
Description

Simulation of a one-lane bridge where vehicles must follow these rules:

    No two vehicles moving in opposite directions can be on the bridge at the same time.
    Maximum N vehicles can be on the bridge at once.
    No vehicle should be indefinitely blocked by continuous traffic from the opposite side.

Implementation Details:

    Each vehicle executes entry (enter_bridge) and exit (exit_bridge) functions to synchronize crossing.
    Vehicles are spawned dynamically from input at different time intervals.
    Custom binary semaphores ensure synchronization without a central traffic controller thread.
    
The program is compiled using the provided Makefile, generating an executable named 'all'. It runs with ./all and prompts the user to enter five values (three integers and two doubles) in the following order:

    Total number of cars in the simulation (a)
    Bridge capacity (b)
    Time interval for the arrival of the next car (c)
    Time required for a car to cross the bridge (d)
    Maximum number of cars that can pass in one direction before traffic switches (e)

The values should be entered as: <a> <b> <c> <d> <e>
Example input: 20 4 0.5 2.5 6

Print Colors:

    Red: Cars arriving from the left.
    Blue: Cars arriving from the right.
    Yellow: Direction change and explanation.
    White: Entry and exit of cars on the bridge.

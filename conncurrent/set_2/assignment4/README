2.4 Roller Coaster Simulation
Description

A simulation of a roller coaster ride in an amusement park, where:

    The coaster holds N passengers and starts only when full.
    Passengers board and exit in a synchronized manner.
    The ride duration is simulated using artificial delays.

Implementation Constraints:

    Synchronization is handled only with custom binary semaphores.
    No helper threads â€“ the roller coaster and passengers act as independent threads.
    Passengers are spawned dynamically based on input parameters.
    
The program is compiled using make with the provided Makefile, generating an executable named 'all'. It runs with the command:
./all <capacity> <number_of_passengers> <ride_duration> <passenger_arrival_interval>
where:

    capacity: Maximum number of passengers the train can hold.
    number_of_passengers: Total passenger threads created in the program.
    ride_duration: Time taken for the train to complete one ride.
    passenger_arrival_interval: Time interval between the creation of each passenger.

Print Colors:

    Green: Passenger enters the train.
    Red: Passenger exits the train.
    Blue: Train status and ride information.
    White: Other messages.

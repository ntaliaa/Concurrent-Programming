3.4 Roller Coaster (with Monitor Controller)
Description

This is a modification of Assignment 2.4 (Roller Coaster Simulation), where the synchronization is now handled using a monitor instead of binary semaphores.

Implementation Details:

    Uses mutexes and condition variables (pthread in C) or synchronized methods and wait/notify (Java).
    The simulation follows the same behavior as in 2.4, ensuring passengers board and exit correctly.
    
Program Execution

The assignment is compiled using make with the Makefile provided in the folder.

To run the program, use the command:

./all <capacity> <number_of_passengers> <ride_duration> <passenger_arrival_interval>

where:

    capacity: Maximum number of passengers the train can hold.
    number_of_passengers: Total passenger threads created in the program.
    ride_duration: Time taken for the train to complete one ride.
    passenger_arrival_interval: Time interval between the creation of each passenger.

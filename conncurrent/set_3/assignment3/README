Description

This is a modification of Assignment 2.3 (Narrow Bridge), replacing binary semaphores with a monitor-based synchronization approach.

    Time required for a car to cross the bridge (d)
    Maximum number of cars that can pass in one direction before traffic must switch (e)

The input format should be:
